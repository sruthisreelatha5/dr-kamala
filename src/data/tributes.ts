		text: "A little girl jumping and dancing around, holding the hands of her Grandpa, is my earliest reminiscence of Kamala. Within no time we became best buddies. Our families bonded well and both of us would spend our childhood days at each other's place often. Always cheerful, benevolent and loving, she was also one of the bravest persons I have ever met. The courage and strength exuded by her continue to inspire me to face life with grace and determination and find hope even in the darkest moments.\n\nIt is indeed gratifying to know that her talent as a poet will now be recognized through this anthology of poems written by her. My sincere appreciation to Kamala's family who made it possible. An amazing person, dear Kamala, you may be gone, but you will never be forgotten.",

		text: "Kamala was my batchmate at Vidyadhiraja School. We sang together in group songs during school festivals and were among those who rendered the school prayer every morning. Kamala was a singer trained in classical music, and even in those early years, her voice carried devotion and depth.\n\nAfter matriculation, life took us on different journeys. It was Kamala who took the initiative to contact our batchmates after 30 years and organize the reunion. I could sense a quiet grace in her leadership, an ability to bring hearts together with warmth, purpose, and humility.\n\nA few months later, Kamala informed me that she had been diagnosed with a serious ailment. There was courage in her voice, and an unspoken acceptance of life's larger design. She asked me to send her a song I used to sing during our schooldays — a request that changed my own journey. Professional commitments had prevented me from singing for more than ten years. Her request felt like a divine nudge. I began singing again, recording devotional songs, and sharing them with Kamala, unaware then that this was also a healing path for me.\n\nIn ways beyond my understanding, Kamala became an instrument of grace, bringing me back to music and helping me rediscover a form of worship that continues in my life even today. She was a radiant soul, always smiling, deeply compassionate, and instinctively drawn to support those in need. She possessed the rare spiritual quality of awakening the gifts in others, gently and selflessly.\n\nEven now, it is hard to accept that Kamala is no longer with us. Yet, her spirit lives on — in prayers, in music, and in the lives she quietly transformed.",

		text: "I met Kamala Chechi during my research days at the Institute of English. With her friendly nature and exuberance, it was easy to like her and be friends with her, a bond that grew stronger over the years. More than being a colleague to me she often donned the role of a mentor, guiding me through my never ending dilemmas.\n\nAn exceptional teacher, her passion for teaching has inspired countless students. Her dedication to her craft was evident in every lecture as is vouched by her students. As a colleague, she brought warmth and kindness — qualities often found lacking in academia — to the department. With her departure I have lost a trusty protective shield, a loving shelter to whose warmth I could take refuge in, whenever I had some problem.",

Students liked her and her classes, which were both interesting and informative. For the rest of us she was either a daughter or a sister. We used to address her as "Prakasham Parathunna Pennkutty" — the girl who radiates light. I remember her still as a slender and youthful girl, with romance in her heart, stars in her eyes and a pleasant smile on her lips.',

		title: "Kamala, my friend\u2026",
		text: "I first heard of Kamala when I was an undergraduate student of English Literature at Women's College, Trivandrum. She was my senior, spoken of by classmates with a quiet reverence. As the granddaughter of the legendary Professor K.P.K. Menon and daughter of the renowned academic Dr. K. Radha, both English Professors, Kamala seemed to inhabit an inherited aura of excellence. When she secured the First Rank for M.A. English Literature, my awe of her deepened.\n\nThat distance vanished when I joined the Institute of English for Doctoral studies. Through mutual friends I quickly realized how wrong my initial assumptions had been. She was not a peevish nerd, but spontaneous and fun-loving; we hardly spoke of studies at all! Our bond deepened further when we discovered a shared history: our grandfathers had known each other.\n\nAt the Institute, we were inseparable. Her social circle was vast, encompassing almost everyone within the university's orbit. Despite her impressive academic lineage, and her own achievements, she was remarkably humble, carrying no 'airs' about herself. Her lithe frame, graceful movements and long hair made Kamala seem like a fairy drifting in a saree. Yet it was her radiant smile — ever-present, never fading — that was her true hallmark.\n\nShe had made it a habit to visit me in my hostel every single morning. When she came from Alappuzha, she always brought a thoughtful gift — a quirky nighty or a dupatta she thought I'd like. She was generous to a fault, giving freely of her time, her means, and her heart.\n\nAt her daughter's wedding, we reunited — but she was the \"bright absentee.\" That would have been a grand carnival for her, she missed it and we all missed her.\n\nKamala, you burned like a candle to give others light, never counting the cost, even when the cost was life itself. I miss you, my dear friend. Yet your memory blooms like an eternal lotus in my heart, untouched by time.",

All of us turned to her when lessons felt difficult — she had a rare gift for making even the trickiest concepts simple, the mark of a born teacher.\n\nHer voice, laughter, warmth, and compassion remain vivid in my memory, as does the quiet courage she showed when we last met. To say that I miss her would barely outline the void she has left.",

We were together in Pre Degree and BA. Always bubbly and cheerful, not even once have I seen her sulk. She was always smiles and it showed in her twinkling eyes.\n\nWhen I was getting married Kamala accompanied me to invite the lecturers of my college and also my other college mates. During her last years too she was always smiling, not letting out her sadness. We loved Kamala and always will.",

		text: "Some friendships do not need decades. They bloom in silence, flourish in brief seasons, and stay forever. My bond with Dr. R. Kamala — whom I called Kamaledathi — was one such sacred connection. We shared only five years together as colleagues and friends, but in that time, we became something deeper than friends; we became each other's quiet strength.\n\nKamaledathi embodied elegance, carrying herself with effortless grace. Her carefully chosen sarees, earrings, bangles and the natural radiant smile made her different. Her gentle, kind, open, loquacious behaviour made her extraordinary. She was down-to-earth and effortlessly warm, approachable to students, colleagues and friends alike. A passionate teacher, she found joy in spreading light in the classroom, in conversations, in celebrations both big and small.\n\nMarch 2014 drifted in heavy with some unspoken fears. The endless tests, the bronchoscopy, and finally, the cruel certainty of cancer shook us to the core. She accepted her truth with grace and chose to fight bravely. Despite pain and fatigue, she welcomed me with care, never letting illness diminish her warmth or dignity.\n\nEven within hospital walls, she created a garden of friendship, touching doctors, nurses, patients, and strangers alike. She celebrated life in every moment — festivals, birthdays, and ordinary days — with a spirit that remained unshaken.\n\nKamaledathi is no longer beside me, but she walks with me — on every Monday that dawns, in every lunch shared with love, in every moment when kindness finds a voice. She is not gone, she has transformed — into memory, into meaning, into a presence that time cannot erase.\n\nForever remembered. Forever missed. Forever my Kamaledathi.",

She is a remarkable woman who was truly an all-rounder in every sense of the word. She balanced her many roles with grace, excelling in her responsibilities while always making time to care for others.\n\nAs far as I know, she was a hardworking and a compassionate woman. She inspired many people around her through her strength, dedication, and positive spirit. Her presence touched many lives, and her legacy of resilience, kindness, and excellence will be remembered with utmost love and respect today and always.\n\nI feel truly fortunate to have had the opportunity to work and to learn so many new things along the way with Kamala Amma. Her versatility, dedication, caring nature and willingness to share knowledge made my experience meaningful. Working alongside her was both inspiring and enriching.",
